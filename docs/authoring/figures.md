# Images and figures

MyST Markdown provides a few different syntaxes for including images in your documents.

:::{seealso}
For more information about images and figures, see the [MyST guide on figures](https://mystmd.org/guide/figures).
:::

## Images

The first is the standard Markdown syntax:

```md
![fishy](../images/fun-fish.png)
```

This will correctly copy the image to the build folder and render it in all output formats (HTML, PDF, etc).
However, it is limited in the configuration that can be applied. For example, the image width cannot be set with this syntax.

MyST allows for directives such as `image` and `figure` to be used for more control.

As an example,

````md
```{image} ../images/fun-fish.png
:alt: fishy
:class: bg-primary
:width: 200px
:align: center
```
````

will include a customized image with specific width, alignment, and styling.

These directives allow you to control aspects of the image with directive options.

### Supported image formats

Standard rasterized image formats, such as `.png` and `.jpg`, are supported for both HTML and PDF output formats.
Vector formats such as `.svg` work well for HTML but may need conversion for PDF outputs.

## Figures

MyST Markdown also lets you include **figures** in your page. Figures are
like images, except that they are easier to reference elsewhere in your
book, and they include things like captions. To include a figure, use this
syntax:

````md
```{figure} ../images/C-3PO_droid.png
---
height: 150px
name: directive-fig
---
Here is my figure caption!
```
````

:::{note}
You can also include figures that were generated by your code in notebooks.
Matplotlib and other plotting libraries will automatically create figures when you execute code cells.

## Referencing figures

You can refer to your figures by using the `{ref}` or `{numref}` role:

```md
- {ref}`directive-fig`
- {numref}`directive-fig`
```

### Numbered references

The `{numref}` role will produce numbered references like "Figure 1".

If you provide custom text, you can control what is displayed:

```md
{numref}`See this figure <directive-fig>`
```

With `numref` you can also access the figure number and caption individually:
the sequences "%s" and "{number}" will be replaced with the figure number, while "{name}" will be replaced with the figure caption.

For example, `` {numref}`Figure {number}: {name} <directive-fig>` `` will produce a reference like "Figure 1: Here is my figure caption!".

## Figure scaling and aligning

Figures can be aligned using the `:align:` option with values `left`, `center`, or `right`. By default, figures are centered.

To align a figure to the left with a specific size:

````md
```{figure} ../images/cool.jpg
---
scale: 50%
align: left
---
Here is my figure caption!
```
````

To align right:

````md
```{figure} ../images/cool.jpg
---
scale: 50%
align: right
---
Here is my figure caption!
```
````

## Figure parameters

The following options are commonly used:

`scale`
:  Uniformly scale the figure as a percentage. The default is "100" which indicates no scaling.

`width`
:  Set the figure width in units like "px", "em", "cm", "%", etc.

`height`
:  Set the figure height in units like "px", "em", "cm", etc.

`alt`
:  Text to be displayed if the figure cannot be displayed or for assistive technologies. This is important for accessibility.

`align`
:  Align the figure: "left", "center", or "right". Default is center.

`name`
:  A unique identifier for your figure that you can use to reference it with `{ref}` or `{numref}` roles. Cannot contain spaces or special characters.
