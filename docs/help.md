:::{tip} What is MyST? How is it different from Jupyter Book?
:class: dropdown

Jupyter Book is built on top of the MyST-MD engine. The separation between the two programs is so small that we share the same CLI and configuration files. See [](about/toolchain.md) for more information. Consequently bug reports and discussions should take place on the MyST-MD project.
