# Cite Jupyter Book

Jupyter Book is developed by many people across academia and industry.
Moreover, Jupyter Book is powered by an ecosystem of open source tools, most notably within the [Executable Books Project](https://executablebooks.org).

Rather than citing each tool, we choose to use a single blanket citation for the entire project and all of its community members.

To cite Jupyter Book in publications, please use the following Zenodo reference:

```{only} html
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.2561065.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2561065)
```

The full author list is available by viewing the [contributors graph on GitHub](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/graphs/contributors).
To get the full picture, you should look at this for all projects within [the Executable Books organization](https://github.com/executablebooks).
