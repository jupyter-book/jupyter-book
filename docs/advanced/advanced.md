# How-to and FAQ

This page contains more advanced and complete information about the
[`jupyter-book` repository](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book). See the sections below.

## Enable Google Analytics

If you have a Google Account, you can use Google Analytics to collect some
information on the traffic to your Jupyter Book. With this tool, you can find
out how many people are using your book, where they come from and how they
access it, wether they are using the Desktop or the mobile version etc.

To add Google Analytics to your Jupyter Book, navigate to
[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), create a new
Google Analytics account and add the url of your Jupyter Book to a new
*property*. Once you have set everything up, your Google Analytics property
will have a so-called Tracking-ID, that typically starts with the letters UA.
All that you need to do is to copy this ID and paste it into your
configuration file:

```yaml
google_analytics:
  mytrackingcode: UA-XXXXXXXXX-X
```

## Check external links in your book

If you'd like to make sure that the links outside of your book are valid,
run the Sphinx link checker with Jupyter Book. This will check each of your
external links and ensure that it resolves.

```{margin}
Note that you must ensure each link is
the *right* target, the link checker will only ensure that it resolves.
```

To run the link checker, use the following command:

```
jupyter-book build mybookname/ --builder linkcheck
```

It will print the status of each link in your book so that you may resolve
any incorrect links later on.

## Clean your book's generated files

It is possible to "clean up" the files that you generate when you build
your book. This is often useful if you have recently changed a lot of content
in order to ensure that you build your book from a clean slate.

You can clean up your book's generated content by running the following command:

```bash
jupyter-book clean mybookname/
```

By default, this will delete all folders inside `mybookname/_build` *except*
for a folder called `.jupyter_cache`. This ensures that the *content* of your book
will be regenerated, while the cache that is generated by *running your book's code*
will not be deleted (because regenerating it may take some time).

To delete the `.jupyter_cache` folder as well, add the `--all` flag like so:

```bash
jupyter-book clean mybookname/ --all
```

This will entirely remove the folders in the `_build/` directory.

## How should I add cell tags to my notebooks?

You can control the behavior of Jupyter Book by putting custom tags
in the metadata of your cells. This allows you to do things like
{doc}`automatically hide code cells <../interactive/hiding>`) as well as
{ref}`adding interactive widgets to cells <launch/thebelab>`.

There are two straightforward ways to add metadata to cells:

1. **Use the Jupyter Notebook cell tag editor**. The Jupyter Notebook ships with a
   cell tag editor by default. This lets you add cell tags to each cell quickly.

   To enable the cell tag editor, go click `View -> Cell Toolbar -> Tags`. This
   will enable the tags UI. Here's what the menu looks like.

2. **Use the JupyterLab Cell Tags plugin**. JupyterLab is an IDE-like Jupyter
   environment that runs in your browser. It has a "cell tags" plugin built-in,
   which exposes a user interface that lets you quickly insert cell tags.

   You'll find tags under the "wrench" menu section.
   Here's what the tags UI in JupyterLab looks like.

### Add tags to notebook cells based on their content

Sometimes you'd like to quickly scan through a notebook's cells in order to
add tags based on the content of the cell. For example, you might want to
hide any cell with an import statement in it using the `remove-input` tag.

Here's a short Python snippet to accomplish something close to this.
First change directories into the root of your book folder, and then
run the script below as a Python script or within a Jupyter Notebook
(modifying as necessary for your use case).
Finally, check the changes that will be made and commit them to your repository.

```python
import nbformat as nbf
from glob import glob

# Collect a list of all notebooks in the content folder
notebooks = glob("./content/**/*.ipynb", recursive=True)

# Text to look for in adding tags
text_search_dict = {
    "# HIDDEN": "remove-cell",  # Remove the whole cell
    "# NO CODE": "remove-input",  # Remove only the input
    "# HIDE CODE": "hide-input"  # Hide the input w/ a button to show
}

# Search through each notebook and look for th text, add a tag if necessary
for ipath in notebooks:
    ntbk = nbf.read(ipath, nbf.NO_CONVERT)

    for cell in ntbk.cells:
        cell_tags = cell.get('metadata', {}).get('tags', [])
        for key, val in text_search_dict.items():
            if key in cell['source']:
                if val not in cell_tags:
                    cell_tags.append(val)
        if len(cell_tags) > 0:
            cell['metadata']['tags'] = cell_tags

    nbf.write(ntbk, ipath)
```

(raw-html-in-markdown)=
## Use raw html in Markdown

Jupyter notebook markdown allows you to use pure HTML in markdown cells.
This is strongly discouraged and not guaranteed to work in all cases.

If, for instance, you use

```
<img src="images/some/file.png" alt="Some image" style="width: 200px;"/>
```

in your Markdown texts, the source file `images/some/file.png` will not
be copied to the build directory when you run `jupyter-book build`.
You would have to copy the source file to the
build directory manually. Note that MyST markdown gives you control over the
{ref}`image appearance<content-blocks-images>` without having to resort
to pure html.

## Adding extra HTML to your book

There are a few places in Jupyter Book where you can add arbitrary extra HTML.
In all cases, this is done with a configuration value in your `_config.yml` file.

### Extra HTML in your footer

To add extra HTML in your book's footer, use the following configuration:

```yaml
html:
    extra_footer: |
        <div>
            your html
        </div>
```

The contents of `extra_footer` will be inserted into your page's HTML after
all other footer content.

### Extra HTML to your left navbar

To add extra HTML in your book's left navbar, use the following configuration:

```yaml
html:
    extra_navbar: |
        <div>
            your html
        </div>
```

The contents of `extra_navbar` will be inserted into your page's HTML after
all other html content.
