:::{seealso} Never used Jupyter Book before?
:class: dropdown

Jupyter Book 2 is a very thin wrapper around the MyST-MD engine: it shares the same CLI and configuration file (see [](about/toolchain.md) for more details). It serves primarily to as an introduction of the existing Jupyter Book community to the MyST-MD engine.

If you're new to the Jupyter Book project, consider [directly using MyST-MD](https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart).
:::

Jupyter Book is available on the PyPI, conda-forge, and npm package repositories as `jupyter-book>=2`. How you install Jupyter Book depends upon your choice of environment manager.

::::{hint} Should I use `pip` or ...?
:class: dropdown

Installing software can be confusing. Here's a simple guide to making a sensible choice.

1. Are you using an {term}`Environment Manager`?  
   If you are already using an environment manager, you should use that tool to install `jupyter-book`.

2. Are you willing to use an {term}`Environment Manager`?  
   There are lots of environment managers to choose from. If you aren't sure which to choose, it is recommended to start with [a Python virtual environment][venv].

3. Otherwise ...  
   `pip` can install packages into your home directory with

```shell
pip install -U jupyter-book>=2
```

:::{warning} Ignoring environment management
:name: warning:env-management

Ignoring environment management can lead to confusion later when things break. It is recommended to [use a virtual environment][venv] if you do not use an existing tool.
