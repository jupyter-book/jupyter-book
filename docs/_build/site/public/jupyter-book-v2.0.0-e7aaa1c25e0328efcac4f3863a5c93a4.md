## 2.0.0

This is a **major re-write for Jupyter Book**. The back-end of Jupyter Book now uses the [MyST Document Engine](https://mystmd.org). 

Here are a few helpful links if you'd like to learn more:

- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://jupyterbook.org/stable/resources/faq#faq-general)
- [Upgrade from 1.0](https://jupyterbook.org/stable/resources/upgrade#upgrade-tldr)
- [Known limitations](https://jupyterbook.org/stable/resources/faq#known-limitations)

We'll start regular releases now that this switch has been made, but this one was a branch re-write so we'll keep these notes short and recommend you check out https://jupyterbook.org for more information.
