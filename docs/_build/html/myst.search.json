We found some bugs while migrating The Turing Way, and every time the JB2 team were swift to make a fix or find a workaround.

Source\n\nThis release updates the way that static HTML files are generated, to follow pagename/index.html structure rather than pagename.html structure. Any hard-coded links to your MyST site that end in .html will break, instead you should simply remove the .html (e.g. folder/page.html -> folder/page). This makes Jupyter Book and MyST more reliable when hosting with Static Site services like ReadTheDocs.\n\n(\n\nfull
