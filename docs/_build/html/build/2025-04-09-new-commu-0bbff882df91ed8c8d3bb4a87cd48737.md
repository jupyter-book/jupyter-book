If you'd like a chance to meet with the Jupyter Book team on a monthly basis, we're piloting an option for doing so! Jupyter Book is running an experiment to join the [JupyterHub Team](https://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io) in monthly community meetings called **Collaboration Cafes**. This will be a way for Jupyter Book's community to connect with the Jupyter Book team, as well as the JupyterHub team.

The meeting's format means that we'll be able to have Jupyter Book-specific conversations in parallel with the JupyterHub team. We are going to pilot this meeting style for a few months and see if it is valuable to our team and to the Jupyter Book community. As a small team, we can't _guarantee_ we will attend each meeting, but we'll do our best!

Read below for more information about this meeting format.

## What is a Collaboration Cafe?

A Collaboration Cafe is a virtual co-working space [pioneered by The Turing Way][ttw-cafe]. It provides a regular meeting space featuring breakout rooms and [pomodoro](wiki:Pomodoro_Technique) sprints that allows for visitors to collaborate with other attendees on topics that they find interesting. The goal of the format is to make it easy for first-time contributors to get involved, and provide a space for multiple conversations to happen efficiently in parallel.

## Who is welcome?

We encourage _any_ Jupyter Book user with questions to join us. We aim to host conversations from "How do I do X in Jupyter Book" to "How can I add this feature to Jupyter Book?" in the same space. We're particularly keen to encourage anyone who has not engaged with us before to join and say hi!

## Why are we joining JupyterHub's Collaboration Cafe?

The Jupyter Book team are keen to provide a synchronous meeting space for our community. Whilst we considered running our own monthly meetings, to effectively welcome new attendees and operate breakout rooms would not be feasible for our team size and time zones. Thankfully, the JupyterHub team have invited us to join them!

## When is it?

Each month, at alternating days and slightly different formats.

- **Month A**: Tuesdays, shared with the [JupyterHub Collaboration Cafe][hub-cafe].
- **Monthy B**: Wednesdays, with the Jupyter Book community.

See below for links to the various community contact points, which includes the events described here as well as information for connecting.
