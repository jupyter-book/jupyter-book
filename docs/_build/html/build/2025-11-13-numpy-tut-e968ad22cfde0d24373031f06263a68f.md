The [NumPy tutorials site](https://numpy.org/numpy-tutorials/) has upgraded to Jupyter Book 2! The [migration was just merged](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/274), bringing MyST-powered documentation to one of scientific Python's foundational libraries.

This work came out of the [Scientific Python Developer Summit in Copenhagen](https://scientific-python.org/summits/developer/2025-nov/) in November 2025. The summit created space for NumPy contributors to share experiences with the broader ecosystem and tackle the migration as a focused, right-sized project.

The NumPy tutorials maintainers agreed to migrate to JB2 because the material focuses on narrative and notebook content and [doesn't need API documentation](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/1259). Seeing NumPy make this transition is a good sign that JB2 is ready for production use in major open source projects - and that JB2 can cover an even bigger chunk of use-cases once we add API docs support.
