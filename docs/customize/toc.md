# Table of contents structure

There are many ways in which you can control the table of contents for
your book. Most of them involve adding syntax to your `_toc.yml` file.

This page covers a few common options.

```{note}
The {download}`_toc.yml file for this site <../_toc.yml>` has an entry for each
of the features described below for reference.
```

## General TOC structure

The table of contents is broadly organized like so:

* The first entry of your `_toc.yml` file is the *introduction* to your book.
  It is the landing page for the HTML of your book.
* Subsequent entries define either **parts** or **chapters** in your book.
  These make up the main structure of your book. See [](toc/chapters-parts)
  for more information.
* Each chapter can optionally have **sections** that are defined by separate
  files. These are nested underneath the top page of the chapter. See [](toc/structure)
  for more information.
* Throughout the `_toc.yml` file, `- file:` entries point to text files that make up
  your book's content. Their paths are relative to the book's root.

```{note}
By default, the landing page of your book will appear in the navbar, but this can be disabled in your `_config.yml` file by setting the `home_page_in_navbar` option to `false` (under the [html section](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html#configuration-reference)).
```

```{note}
Currently, it is not possible to add nested sections to your landing page (see [#844](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/issues/844))
```

For reference, here is an example similar to this book's `_toc.yml` file:

```yaml
- file: myintro
  numbered: true

- part: Get started
  chapters:
  - file: start/overview
  - file: start/build

- part: Reference and test pages
  chapters:
  - file: test_pages/test
    sections:
      - file: test_pages/layout_elements
      - file: test_pages/equations
```

The sections below cover this information in more depth.

(toc/chapters-parts)=
## Defining chapters and parts in `_toc.yml`

The top layer of entries in your table of contents allows you to define
**chapters** and (optionally) **parts** of your book.

The first entry (`- file: myintro` above) defines the introductory page for your book.
It is also where you can control some behavior for the entire book (in the example
above, we set `numbered: true` to number *all* sections of the book).

Below the first entry you have two options for defining the structure of your book:

1. **A list of chapters.** You can specify each chapter with a `- file:` entry.
   Below is an example `_toc.yml` file with this structure:

   ```yaml
   - file: myintro

   - file: firstchapter
   - file: secondchapter
   ```

2. **A list of parts with chapters.** If you'd like to separate chapters into groups,
   do so by using `- part:` entries in the top level of `_toc.yml`. Each part should have
   a `chapters:` section that contains a list of `- file:` entries, each one pointing
   to the file for a chapter. Below is an example `_toc.yml` file with
   this structure:

   ```yaml
   - file: myintro

   - part: My first part
     chapters:
     - file: part1_firstchapter
     - file: part1_secondchapter
   - part: My second part
     chapters:
     - file: part2_firstchapter
   ```

   Note that **chapters do not continue between parts**. Think of each part as
   a self-contained collection of chapters (e.g., for the purposes of numbering).

:::{admonition,warning} Don't mix these two structures!
When designing the top-level sections of your `_toc.yml` file, you must
pick *either* a list of chapters via `- file:` entries, or a list of parts
via `- part:` entries with chapters inside of them. You cannot intermix them both.
:::

(toc/files)=
### Files

**Files** point to a single file of content in your book's folder. If these files
are at the top level of your `_toc.yml` file, they will denote **chapters**. If they
are nested within another file (via the `sections:` key) then they will denote
**sections** within a chapter.

Here is an example file entry:

```yaml
- file: path/to/myfile
```

Additionally, **files can have nested sections in other files**. These subsections allow you
to define hierarchical structure in your book. For example, you may wish for the top-level
file to serve as an "introduction" for a collection of files underneath, like so:

```yaml
- file: my_intro
  sections:
    - file: my_first_page
    - file: my_second_page
      sections:
        - file: my_second_page_subsection
```

We recommend nesting your sections no more than 3 layers deep (as shown above).

#### Specifying alternate titles

If you'd like to specify an alternate title from the one defined within a file,
you may do so with the `title:` key. For example:

```yaml
- file: path/to/myfile
  title: My alternate page title
```

Note that this only applies to the sidebar
in the table of contents, it does not change the actual chapter/section title.

(toc/numbering)=
## Number your book's chapters and sections

You can automatically add numbers to each chapter of your book. To add numbers
to **all chapters of your book**, add the `numbered: true` flag to
your introduction page entry (the first entry in `_toc.yml`). For example:

```yaml
- file: intro
  numbered: true

- file: chapter1
- file: chapter2
- file: chapter3
```

This will cause all chapters of the book to be
numbered. They will follow a hierarchy according to the sub-sections structure
defined in your `_toc.yml` file.
You can also **limit the TOC numbering depth** by setting the `numbered` flag to an integer instead of `true`, e.g., `numbered: 3`.

If you'd like to number **subsets of chapters**, group them into parts and
apply the `numbered: true` flag to the parts whose chapters you wish to be numbered.
For example:

```yaml
- file: home

# Chapters in this part will not be numbered
- part: Introduction
  chapters:
  - file: page2

# Chapters in this part will be numbered
- part: Part 1
  numbered: true
  chapters:
  - file: chapter1
  - file: chapter2
```

### Numbering caveats and notes

Jupyter Book relies on {term}`Sphinx` to apply section numbering, and this has a
few quirks to it. Here are a few gotchas:

* **Numbering applies to _sections_ of your page**.
  Note that when you add numbering to a section, it will add numbers to *each header
  in a file*. This means that if you have headers in a top-level section, then its
  headers will become numbered as sub-sections, and any other _files_ underneath it
  will begin as third-level children. See [](toc/structure) for more information.
* **Numbering resets across parts**.
  If you specify groups of sections via `- part:` entries, then numbering will restart between
  them. That means if you have two `- part:` entries with 2 pages each, you will
  have two sets of `1.` and `2.` sections, one for each part.

(toc/structure)=
## How headers and sections map onto to book structure

Jupyter Book uses the {term}`Sphinx` documentation engine under the hood, which
represents the structure of your book in a particular way. Different choices
for the structure of `_toc.yml` and the header structures within your pages will
result in different outcomes for your overall book structure. Here are some general
tips and best-practices.

```{note}
This is particularly important when you [number your book's sections](toc/numbering)
or when you [build a PDF of your book through Latex](pdf:latex).
```

**Chapters are at the top of your book hierarchy**. The top level of your `_toc.yml` contains
a list of chapters. The title of each file will be the chapter's title.

**Headers map onto sections**. Jupyter Book interprets your book as a collection of sections,
and decides how those sections should be nested according to the hierarchy of
`_toc.yml` and the hierarchy of headers in a page. Within a file, the first
`## ` header it discovers will define the top-most section in the file, and any subsequent
`### ` headers underneath will become sub-sections (until another `## ` section
is encountered). This behavior is a bit different if the page is *nested* under
another (see below).

**Nested files define sections _underneath_ the last section of their parent**.
If you specify sections that are *nested* under a file (with the `sections:` key)
then those sections will begin *underneath* the last headers of the parent page.

For example, if your `_toc.yml` file looks like this:

```yaml
- file: myintro

- file: chapter1
  sections:
  - file: chapter1section
```

Then the sections of `chapter1section` will begin **under** the sections of `chapter1`.
Any headers in `chapter1section` will be treated as a "next-header-deeper" section in
`chapter1`.

In other words, if `chapter1` and `chapter1section` look like this:

````{panels}
`chapter1.md`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```md
# Chapter 1 title

## Chapter 1 second header
```
---
`chapter1section.md`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```md
# Chapter 1 section title

## Chapter 1 section second header
```
````
Then your book will treat them like so:

```md
# Chapter 1 title

## Chapter 1 second header

### Chapter 1 section title

#### Chapter 1 section second header
```

However, if `chapter1.md` had an extra third-level header, like so:

````{panels}
`chapter1.md`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```md
# Chapter 1 title

## Chapter 1 second header

### Chapter 1 third header
```
---
`chapter1section.md`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```md
# Chapter 1 section title

## Chapter 1 section second header
```
````

Then your book would treat them like so:

```md
# Chapter 1 title

## Chapter 1 second header

### Chapter 1 third header

#### Chapter 1 section title

##### Chapter 1 section second header
```

Keep this in mind when you design the structure of your files.

```{tip}
A good rule of thumb is to take one of these two approaches:

1. **don't put headers in your introduction pages**. This is
   true for both the book's introduction, as well as for any chapter introductions.
   Instead, leave the headers to pages that have more content in them, and use
   **bolded text** where you would otherwise use headers.
2. **Use a flat list of files instead of nested files**. This way the section
   hierarchy is defined only in a single file within each section. However, this
   means you will have longer files in general.
```

## Exclude some pages from your book's build

By default, Jupyter Book will build all content files that are found in your book's
folder, even if they are not specified in `_toc.yml` (and will raise a warning if
it finds a file that isn't listed there).

If you'd like Jupyter Book to skip a file entirely, you can do so with the following
configuration in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
exclude_patterns: [pattern1/*, path/to/myfile.ipynb]
```

Any files that match the patterns described there will be excluded from the build.
If you'd like to exclude files from being *executed* but still wish for them to be
built by Jupyter Book, see [](execute/exclude).

## Web-based navigation bar functionality

The following sections apply to controlling the left navigation bar in
HTML books built with Jupyter Book.

### Add external links

You can also add external links to websites that are outside of your book.
To do so, use the following pattern:

```yaml
- url: https://yoururl.com
```

The URL will be placed alongside the links to other pages above and below the
entry.

### Add a table of contents to a page's content

If you'd like to add a table of contents for the sub-sections of a page
*within the page content* (in-line with the content on the page), you
may do so by using the `{tableofcontents}` directive. You can use it like so:

````md
```{tableofcontents}
```
````

See the source of [the content types page](../file-types/index.md) for an example.

## Automatically generate your `_toc.yml` file

You can use `jupyter-book` to *generate* a table of contents file from your book
using the filenames of your book's content. To do so, run the following command

```bash
jupyter-book toc mybookpath/
```

Jupyter Book will search `mybookpath/` for any [content files](../file-types/index)
and create a `_toc.yml` file out of them. There are a few considerations to keep in mind:

* Each sub-folder must have at least one content file inside it
* The ordering of files in `_toc.yml` will depend on the alphanumeric order of
  the filenames (e.g., `folder_01` comes before `folder_02`, and `apage` comes
  before `b_page`)
* If there is a file called `index.md` in any folder, it will be listed first.

You may also **generate navigation bar *titles* from each file of your book**.
If you do so, note that if the file name begins with `<integer>_filename.md`, then
the `<integer>` part will be removed before it is inserted into `_toc.yml`.
