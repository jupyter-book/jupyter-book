:::{important} Objective
The goal of this tutorial is to walk existing users through the process of upgrading their books to Jupyter Book 2.  
:::

:::{hint} TL;DR
Run the new `jupyter book` command inside your existing {term}`Legacy Book` to automatically upgrade it to Jupyter Book 2. This process is automated
but you might need to clean up a few things by hand to eliminate warnings.

## Structure of a Legacy Book

Before we can upgrade a {term}`Legacy Book`, we must first discuss its important files and structure.

### Generating a Legacy Book

Jupyter Book 1 uses [the Sphinx documentation engine](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to build each book into publication-quality books and documents. Sphinx was originally designed for documentation generation, such as <https://docs.python.org>, and has a long historical legacy. In order to hide the complexity that stems from making a documentation engine behave like a book authoring tool, Jupyter Book 1 introduced its own configuration files and CLI to build a book. Consequently, a {term}`Legacy Book` is required to have a number of configuration files (see [](#legacy-config-files)).

:::{table} {term}`Legacy Book` configuration files.
:name: legacy-config-files

|   Filename    |                                           Purpose                                           |
| :-----------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  `_toc.yml`   |   To define the documents that comprise the contents of a book in the form of a site-map.   |
| `_config.yml` | To define configuration options that customize the content, structure, and style of a book. |

:::

An example {term}`Legacy Book` can be seen by running the _legacy_ Jupyter Book `create` command:

```shell
$ jupyter book --version
Jupyter Book      : 1.0.2
External ToC      : 1.0.1
MyST-Parser       : 2.0.0
MyST-NB           : 1.1.1
Sphinx Book Theme : 1.1.3
Jupyter-Cache     : 1.0.0
NbClient          : 0.10.0

$ jupyter book create ./book
===============================================================================

Your book template can be found at

    book/

===============================================================================
```

If we inspect the contents of the generated `book` directory, it can be seen that a number of files have been created:

```{code} shell
:caption: Contents of a {term}`Legacy Book` created using the legacy `jupyter book create` command.
:name: legacy-contents

$ ls ./book
.
..
_config.yml
_toc.yml
intro.md
logo.png
markdown-notebooks.md
markdown.md
notebooks.ipynb
references.bib
requirements.txt
```

### Configuration Files

The most important files in a {term}`Legacy Book` are the [`_config.yml`](#code:example-config) and [`_toc.yml`](#code:example-toc) files described in [](#legacy-config-files). These files control what a book contains and what it looks like.

```{code} yaml
:filename: _config.yml
:name: code:example-config
:caption: Extract from the `_config.yml` file produced by the legacy `jupyter book create` command.

# Force re-execution of notebooks on each build.
# See https://jupyterbook.org/content/execute.html
execute:
  execute_notebooks: force

# ...
```

```{code} yaml
:filename: _toc.yml
:name: code:example-toc
:caption: The `_toc.yml` file produced by the legacy `jupyter book create` command.

# Table of contents
# Learn more at https://jupyterbook.org/customize/toc.html

format: jb-book
root: intro
chapters:
- file: markdown
- file: notebooks
- file: markdown-notebooks
```

Some advanced books may have chosen to stop using Jupyter Book's configuration and use Sphinx directly. These books do not define a `_config.yml`, instead they utilise a Sphinx-style `conf.py` file.

### Bibliography File

In addition to the configuration files, there is also a bibliography file called [`references.bib`](#code:example-bib), which contains a list of references to academic publications.

```{code} bibtex
:filename: references.bib
:name: code:example-bib
:caption: Extract from the `references.bib` file produced by the legacy `jupyter book create` command.

@inproceedings{holdgraf_evidence_2014,
	address = {Brisbane, Australia, Australia},
	title = {Evidence for {Predictive} {Coding} in {Human} {Auditory} {Cortex}},
	booktitle = {International {Conference} on {Cognitive} {Neuroscience}},
	publisher = {Frontiers in Neuroscience},
	author = {Holdgraf, Christopher Ramsay and de Heer, Wendy and Pasley, Brian N. and Knight, Robert T.},
	year = {2014}
}

...

```

This file contains references written in the [BibTeX File Format](https://www.bibtex.org/Format/), which is well-understood by tools such as the [LaTeX document preparation system](https://www.latex-project.org/about/) that is used for PDF export.

### Requirements File

Finally, a [`requirements.txt`](#code:example-requirements) file is often used to define the Python packages required to build the book. This file is normally used both to install Jupyter Book (and related tools) and run any executable Python code.

```{code} text
:filename: requirements.txt
:name: code:example-requirements
:caption: The `requirements.txt` file produced by the legacy `jupyter book create` command.

jupyter-book
matplotlib
numpy
```

## Structure of a New Book

Now that we know what a {term}`Legacy Book` looks like, we can compare its structure with a {term}`New Book`.

### Configuration Files

The new Jupyter Book has a single configuration file `myst.yml`. See the [](#code:myst-example-config) for the `myst.yml` that corresponds to [](#code:example-config).

```{code} yaml
:filename: myst.yml
:name: code:myst-example-config
:caption: Contents of the `myst.yml` file that corresponds to [](#code:example-config).

version: 1
project:
  title: My sample book
  authors:
    - name: The Jupyter Book Community
  github: executablebooks/jupyter-book
  bibliography:
    - references.bib
  exports:
    - format: pdf
      template: plain_latex_book
      output: exports/book.pdf
  toc:
    - file: intro.md
    - file: markdown.md
    - file: notebooks.ipynb
    - file: markdown-notebooks.md
site:
  options:
    logo: logo.png
  template: book-theme
```

It can be seen that [](#code:myst-example-config) has a `toc` section that looks very similar to [](#code:example-toc). This style of defining a TOC is designed to be easier to read and write.

### Bibliography File

Just like Jupyter Book 1, Jupyter Book 2 understands academic references defined in `references.bib`.

### Requirements File

Neither Jupyter Book 1 and 2 do anything useful with a `requirements.txt` file, but it is useful when adding support for Binder connectivity.

## Upgrading a Legacy Book

Whilst Jupyter Book 1 was built upon the _Sphinx_ document engine, Jupyter Book 2 is built upon the [_MyST-MD_ engine](https://mystmd.org). The reasons for this transition are outlined in [](./about/why-switch-mystmd.md). Unlike Jupyter Book 1, Jupyter Book 2 does not try to hide the fact that it is built on a different engine; MyST-MD is designed from the ground up to be good at technical writing, and the Executable Books team believe that it is both powerful and easy-to-use. As such, Jupyter Book 2 builds on top of MyST-MD, using the same CLI and `myst.yml`.

% TODO: link or embed myst.yml?

Jupyter Book will automatically upgrade a {term}`Legacy Book` to a {term}`New Book` by looking for the `_config.yml` file described in [](#section:structure-legacy-book). To do this, we need to run the _new_ `jupyter book` command in the Legacy Book directory. Let's try this tool with the example book given above.

% TODO: what should this report?

First, let's confirm that we're now using the _new_ Jupyter Book tool:

```{code} shell
$ jupyter book --version

```

We can then run the `jupyter book` command, which will detect the {term}`Legacy Book` and ask to perform an in-place upgrade:

```{code} shell
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 15,16,17
:name: code:upgrade-prompt

$ cd book
$ jupyter book
Welcome to the Jupyter Book (myst) CLI! üéâ üöÄ

jupyter book init walks you through creating a myst.yml file.

You can use Jupyter Book (myst) to:

 - create interactive websites from markdown and Jupyter Notebooks üìà
 - build & export professional PDFs and Word documents üìÑ

Learn more about this CLI and MyST Markdown at: https://mystmd.org

? üìò Found a legacy Jupyter Book. To proceed, myst needs to perform an upgrade which will:
‚Ä£ Upgrade any Sphinx-style glossaries to MyST-style glossaries
‚Ä£ Upgrade any case-insensitive admonition names to lowercase (Note ‚Üí note)
‚Ä£ Migrate configuration from _config.yml and (if applicable) _toc.yml files
‚Ä£ Rename any modified or unneeded files so that they are hidden

Are you willing to proceed? (Y/n)
```

Pressing <kbd>Y</kbd> will start the upgrade process, during which time Jupyter Book reports the steps that take place, e.g. the lines highlighted in [](#code:upgrade-steps). For this particular book, the configuration files from the Legacy Book are migrated:

```{code} shell
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 3,4
:name: code:upgrade-steps

Are you willing to proceed? (Y/n) Yes
üíæ Writing new config file: myst.yml
Migrating Jupyter Book configuration to myst.yml
Migrating TOC to myst.yml
```

We can see that the migration step has created some {term}`Hidden Files` (see [](#upgraded-contents)). This ensures that you can recover the original files if something goes wrong during the upgrade.

```{code} shell
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 5,14
:caption: Contents of an {term}`Legacy Book` upgraded with the new `jupyter book create` command.
:name: upgraded-contents

$ ls -a
.
..
_build
._config.yml.myst.bak
intro.md
logo.png
markdown.md
markdown-notebooks.md
myst.yml
notebooks.ipynb
references.bib
requirements.txt
._toc.yml.myst.bak
```

Finally, Jupyter Book then asks us whether we'd like to run `jupyter book start`.

```{code} shell
? Would you like to run myst start now?
```

We can press the {kbd}`y` key in this terminal window to launch a MyST webserver. Clicking the generated link (or pasting it into a new browser tab) will allow us to preview our site and see changes quickly reflected in the browser (see [](#image:screenshot)).
