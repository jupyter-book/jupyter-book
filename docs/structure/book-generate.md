# Generate book files from a Table of Contents

It is possible to use a `_toc.yml` file in order to create the skeleton of a book automatically.
This is useful if you wish to quickly generate empty files from a single structure, and then populate them with content yourselves.

To create your book's files from the Table of Contents, use the following command:

```bash
jupyter-book toc to-project path/to/_toc.yml
```

This will generate a collection of files according to the structure in `_toc.yml`.

In addition, you have a few options to control the behavior of this tool.
See below for reference.

```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-input]
!jupyter-book toc to-project -h
```
