:::{tip} What is MyST? How is it different from Jupyter Book?
:class: dropdown

Jupyter Book is built on top of the MyST Document Engine.
The separation between the two applications is so small that we share the same CLI and configuration files.
See [our ecosystem documentation](ecosystem.md) for more information.

Bug reports and requests should take place on the [`mystmd/` repository](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd), since that is where most changes will happen.
