# Roadmap and priorities

We use a GitHub Project board to track our team's short- and long-term priorities[^1]. This [Priorities View](https://github.com/orgs/jupyter-book/projects/1/views/7) has issues we're actively interested in resolving, and this [Roadmap view](https://github.com/orgs/jupyter-book/projects/1/views/1) has a longer-term vision for major milestones of the project.

```{issue-table} https://github.com/orgs/jupyter-book/projects/1/views/7
:columns: title, Team Priority, linked_prs, reactions, updated
:sort:Team Priority-asc,reactions-desc
:limit:1000
:date-format: relative
```

[^1]: Our roadmap and priorities are constantly changing, and they are *not* commitments to do the work on any kind of timeline (or at all!). They are simply a way for us to help coordinate attention and work in the community, and to focus them on the things that feel most important to the team.
