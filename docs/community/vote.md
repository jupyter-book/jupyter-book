# Issue voting board

This page shows open issues from repositories in the `jupyter-book` organization, sorted by positive reactions (👍 and ❤️)[^1]. If you'd like to see an issue get signal-boosted, add your own reaction—this helps us see what the community cares about, but it's not a commitment that we'll work on the issue.

[^1]: _This is not a guarantee any of these will be worked on!_ It's just a way for the community to signal-boost things - our volunteer team ultimately works on what we can based on our capacity.
