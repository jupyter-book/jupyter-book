# Vote on Issues

This page shows open issues sorted by community votes (üëç and ‚ù§Ô∏è reactions)[^1].
If you'd like to see an issue get signal-boosted, add your own reaction and it'll change the order in the table here.[^2]

[^2]: _This is not a guarantee any of these will be worked on!_ It's just a way for the community to signal-boost things - our volunteer team ultimately works on what we can based on our capacity.

[^1]: This includes issues from both Jupyter Book repositories (including legacy Jupyter Book 1.0 issues) and the MyST Markdown engine repositories that power Jupyter Book 2.
Over time we'll try to clean this up so they only reflect Jupyter Book 2 / MyST Engine issues.


:::{note} The `github-data` repository provides this data
:class: dropdown
This data comes from [jupyter.org/github-data](https://jupyter.org/github-data), which scrapes GitHub data across the Jupyter project and exposes it as an accessible GitHub release artifact.

**Why we can't embed from github-data:** We'd prefer to embed this table directly from [jupyter.org/github-data](https://jupyter.org/github-data), but styled dataframes with Markdown formatting don't properly embed. See https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/2377
