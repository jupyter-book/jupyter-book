Jupyter Book is an open-source tool for building publication-quality books and documents from computational material.

Jupyter Book allows users to

- write their content in Markdown files or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks,
- include computational elements (e.g., code cells) in either type,
- include rich syntax such as citations, cross-references, and numbered equations, and
- using a simple command, run the embedded code cells, cache the outputs and convert this content into:
  - a web-based interactive book and
  - a publication-quality PDF.
