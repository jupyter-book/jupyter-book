    "\n",
    "To install the Jupyter Book command-line interface (CLI), use `pip`!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install jupyter-book\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "alternatively, if you'd like to install the latest version from GitHub,\n",
    "you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "built from), though it might be a bit less-stable.\n",

    "### Create a new book\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've installed the CLI, create a new book using the demo book content\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter-book create mybookname --demo\n",

    "\n",
    "### Build the markdown for your book\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, build the markdown that Jekyll will use for your book. Run this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter-book build mybookname\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### That's it!\n",
